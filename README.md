# GroupC_Egypt_HomeAssignment

Group C: Egypt Country Report

1. Introduction
This project analyzes key economic and demographic developments in Egypt over recent decades. The analysis is divided into four major parts:

   1. GDP per Capita
Analysis of Egypt’s real GDP per capita using chain-linked volume series.
A comparison of GDP per capita on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis in 2019 with selected neighboring countries.

  2. Population Trends
Examination of Egypt’s total population growth from the 1960s to the present.
Analysis of the evolving age structure, reflecting demographic transitions such as declining fertility rates and an expanding working-age population.

  3. Structural Transformation
Study of shifts in Egypt’s employment structure, highlighting the movement from agriculture toward services.
Comparison of value added shares across agriculture, industry, and services.

  4. Open Economy Indicators
Evaluation of Egypt’s external economic position via current account balances, trade balance, and net foreign asset position as percentages of GDP.

2. Project Structure
     1. GroupC_Egypt_HomeAssignment.pdf
Contains the detailed analysis, visualizations, and discussion for each section of the study.

     2. Egypt_coding.R
The R script that:
Downloads data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) via the WDI package.
Generates visualizations using ggplot2.
Performs data manipulation using dplyr and reshapes data with reshape2.

3. Data Source
The primary source of data for this analysis is the World Development Indicators (WDI) provided by the World Bank. The WDI dataset offers a comprehensive set of economic, demographic, and social indicators which have been crucial for this analysis.

4. License
This project is released under the MIT License. This means that you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code and documentation provided here, subject to the terms of the MIT License. For more details, please refer to the LICENSE file in the repository (if available) or include the full MIT License text with your project.

5. Handling Missing Values
When working with the WDI data:
Data Retrieval: Some of the retrieved time series data might have missing values for certain years or indicators. This is common in large international datasets.
Pre-processing: In this project, missing values are handled by ensuring that the analysis focuses on the periods and indicators with reliable and sufficient data points.
Visualization Impact: If missing values occur, they are either omitted from the plots or interpolated (if necessary) depending on the requirements of the specific analysis. The code provided in Egypt_coding.R uses standard R functions that automatically manage these scenarios.
Documentation: The approach to handling missing values is documented in the script comments, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

6. Running the Code
Requirements
Ensure the following R packages are installed:
WDI: For downloading data from the World Bank.
ggplot2: For generating visualizations.
reshape2: For reshaping data formats.
dplyr: For data manipulation.

Install these packages with:
install.packages("WDI")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("dplyr")

Instructions
Open the R Script:
Open Egypt_coding.R in your preferred R environment or IDE.

Install Dependencies:
Run the installation commands (if not already installed).

Execute the Script:
Running the script will:

Download the necessary data for Egypt.
Generate multiple plots for GDP per capita, population trends, employment and value added shares, as well as open economy indicators.
Handle missing values according to the logic embedded in the code.

Review the Output:
The script produces visualizations that are used to analyze the trends and patterns in the economic and demographic data.

7. Repository and Version Control
